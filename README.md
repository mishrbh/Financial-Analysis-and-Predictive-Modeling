## Steps considered for the project


#### Step 1: Data Preparation
1.	Load the Data: Read the stock data and S&P 500 index data.
2.	Inspect the Data: Check for any missing values or inconsistencies and handle them appropriately.
3.	Preprocess the Data: Normalize or standardize the data if necessary.
#### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1.	Summary Statistics: Calculate and visualize summary statistics for each stock.
2.	Visualizations: Create visualizations to understand trends and patterns in the stock prices and volumes.
o	Line plots of stock prices over time.
o	Candlestick charts for detailed price movements.
o	Volume traded over time.
#### Step 3: Technical Analysis
1.	Moving Averages: Calculate simple and exponential moving averages.
2.	Relative Strength Index (RSI): Calculate the RSI to understand momentum.
3.	Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Calculate MACD for trend analysis.
4.	Bollinger Bands: Calculate Bollinger Bands to understand volatility.
#### Step 4: Risk and Return Metrics
1.	Daily Returns: Calculate daily returns for each stock.
2.	Annualized Return and Volatility: Calculate annualized return and volatility.
3.	Sharpe Ratio: Calculate the Sharpe Ratio for risk-adjusted return.
#### Step 5: Compare Against S&P 500
1.	Benchmark Comparison: Compare the performance of each stock against the S&P 500 index.
o	Calculate the beta of each stock relative to the S&P 500.
o	Plot the stock returns against the S&P 500 returns.
#### Step 6: Stock Selection
1.	Investment Criteria: Based on the risk and return metrics, select stocks that align with the conservative investment profile of Alexandra.
2.	CAPM Validation: Validate the selected stocks using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
#### Step 7: Predictive Modeling
1.	Model Selection: Choose a predictive model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to estimate future returns.
2.	Model Training: Train the model on historical data.
3.	Prediction: Predict the returns for the investment period.
#### Step 8: Portfolio Construction and Validation
1.	Portfolio Optimization: Construct an optimal portfolio using techniques like Mean-Variance Optimization.
2.	Backtesting: Backtest the portfolio to check its performance over the historical period.
3.	Validation: Validate if the portfolio meets Alexandra's financial goals.
